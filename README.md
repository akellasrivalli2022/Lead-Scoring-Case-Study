# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
# **Main Objective::**
Building a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 

# **Problem Statement:**
X Education Company Sells online courses to industry professionals.X Education company gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For 
example, if say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most 
potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’.  If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

# **Business Goal:**
X education company wants to know most promising leads.For that they want to build a Model which identifies the hot leads.
Deployment of the model for the future use.

# **Method of Problem Solving:**
❖ Importing of Data.

❖ Data Preparation and Cleaning of the data for further analysis.

❖ Exploratory Data Analysis: Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis.

❖ Feature Scaling and Dummy Variables creation.

❖ Building a Logistic Regression model a classification Technique used for 
   Making and Prediction.
   
❖ Test the Model on Train and Test Split Using RFE Approach.

❖ Validation and Model Presentation.

❖ Model Interpretation and Conclusion.
